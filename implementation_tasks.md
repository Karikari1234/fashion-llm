2. **Weeks 3-4**: LLM Integration, Basic Conversation Interface
3. **Weeks 5-6**: Style Profile, Basic Recommendations
4. **Weeks 7-8**: Computer Vision, Image Analysis
5. **Weeks 9-10**: Virtual Try-On, Advanced Features
6. **Weeks 11-12**: Performance Optimization, Testing, Documentation

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, start with these key steps:

1. Set up the Next.js project and configure the development environment
2. Implement the basic database connection and authentication system
3. Create the LLM provider interface and Gemini implementation
4. Build a simple chat interface to test the AI integration

Remember to commit your code frequently, write tests as you go, and document your implementation decisions. This will make the codebase maintainable and help you track progress effectively.

Please let me know if you need clarification on any of these tasks or if you encounter any challenges during implementation.
