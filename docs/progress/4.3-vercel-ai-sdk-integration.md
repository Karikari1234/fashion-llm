# 4.3 Vercel AI SDK Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Vercel AI SDK integration with our LLM Provider Architecture. The integration enables a streamlined development experience for AI-powered features, with particular focus on chat functionality. The Vercel AI SDK provides React hooks, streaming utilities, and a middleware system that allows us to enhance the fashion-specific capabilities of our application.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Installed the Vercel AI SDK (`ai` package) and Google provider package (`@ai-sdk/google`)
- ✅ Implemented server-side API endpoint with `GoogleGenerativeAIStream` helper
- ✅ Created a fashion context middleware to enhance AI responses with domain knowledge
- ✅ Developed a chat interface component using the `useChat` hook
- ✅ Set up a test page to demonstrate the integration
- ✅ Updated environment variable examples for the Vercel AI SDK configuration

## Implementation Details

### 1. Server-Side API Integration

The `/api/chat` route handler leverages both our existing LLM Provider Architecture and the Vercel AI SDK to:

1. Process incoming chat requests
2. Apply fashion-specific middleware to enhance prompts
3. Generate streaming responses using the Gemini API
4. Transform and return the responses with the SDK's streaming helpers

Key components of the implementation include:

```typescript
// Creating a Gemini model instance
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(config.providerConfig.apiKey);
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({
  model: config.providerConfig.defaultModel,
  // Configuration options...
});

// Applying fashion context middleware
const enhancedMessage = await fashionContextMiddleware(lastMessage);

// Generating a streaming response
const response = await chat.sendMessageStream(enhancedMessage.content);

// Converting to a web stream with the SDK helper
const stream = GoogleGenerativeAIStream(response);
return new StreamingTextResponse(stream);
```

### 2. Fashion Context Middleware

The fashion context middleware enhances user messages with relevant fashion knowledge:

1. Detects if a message is fashion-related based on keywords
2. Extracts relevant context categories (body types, materials, styles, etc.)
3. Generates contextual information to enhance the AI's understanding
4. Appends this context to the user's message in a way that informs but doesn't disrupt the conversation flow

The middleware uses a knowledge base containing:
- Fashion categories and concepts
- Body types and styling considerations
- Materials and their properties
- Seasonal fashion guidance
- Style aesthetics and principles

### 3. Client-Side Chat Interface

The chat interface component uses the Vercel AI SDK's `useChat` hook to:

1. Manage the chat state (messages, loading status, errors)
2. Handle user input and message submission
3. Process streaming responses for real-time updates
4. Provide a responsive UI across device sizes

```typescript
const { 
  messages, 
  input, 
  handleInputChange, 
  handleSubmit, 
  isLoading, 
  error 
} = useChat({
  api: '/api/chat',
  initialMessages: /* initial messages if any */,
});
```

The component features:
- Real-time message streaming
- Automatic scrolling to the latest message
- Loading indicators
- Error handling
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Environment Configuration

The following environment variables have been added or updated to support the Vercel AI SDK integration:

```
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
GEMINI_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
GEMINI_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Integration with Existing Provider Architecture

**Challenge**: Integrating the Vercel AI SDK with our custom provider architecture presented some architectural decisions.

**Solution**: Rather than replacing our provider architecture, we leveraged both systems together. The server-side API route uses the GoogleGenerativeAI SDK directly but still references our configuration system, while the middleware enhances the capabilities of both systems.

### Streaming Response Handling

**Challenge**: Managing the streaming response format correctly between the Gemini API and the Vercel AI SDK.

**Solution**: Used the `GoogleGenerativeAIStream` helper from the Vercel AI SDK to transform the Gemini API's streaming response into a format that works with the SDK's client-side hooks.

### Fashion Context Enhancement

**Challenge**: Adding fashion-specific knowledge without making responses sound unnatural or repetitive.

**Solution**: Implemented a middleware approach that detects fashion-related queries and adds context instructions only visible to the AI, not in the final response.

## Testing

To verify the implementation is working correctly:

1. Ensure all environment variables are properly set
2. Run the application with `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/chat` in your browser
4. Test with fashion-related queries like:
   - "What should I wear to a summer wedding?"
   - "How can I dress for my pear-shaped body?"
   - "What are good fabric choices for winter clothes?"
   - "Can you suggest a minimalist outfit for work?"

## Next Steps

With the Vercel AI SDK now integrated, the next phase will be to further develop specialized fashion context (task 4.4), building on the middleware foundation we've created. This will involve:

1. Expanding the fashion knowledge base
2. Implementing more sophisticated context detection
3. Adding visual analysis capabilities
4. Developing a feedback mechanism to improve responses over time
