# 4.1 Provider Architecture Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the LLM Provider Architecture, which creates a flexible, typesafe interface for interacting with various LLM services. The architecture follows a factory pattern approach that allows for seamless switching between different LLM providers while maintaining a consistent API.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created a flexible `LLMProvider` interface to standardize interactions with any LLM service
- ✅ Defined TypeScript types for chat messages, completions, and streaming responses
- ✅ Implemented provider factory pattern to easily switch between LLM providers
- ✅ Created secure environment-based API key management for LLM credentials

```

## Key Components

### 1. LLMProvider Interface

The core of the architecture is the `LLMProvider` interface, which defines the contract that all LLM service implementations must follow. This includes methods for:

- Text completions
- Chat completions
- Streaming completions
- Token counting
- Model discovery

### 2. Type Definitions

Comprehensive TypeScript types have been defined for:

- Message roles and structure
- Completion options and responses
- Safety settings
- Error handling
- Streaming callbacks

### 3. Factory Pattern

The provider factory allows dynamically selecting and instantiating LLM providers:

- `createLLMProvider(type, config)` - Creates a provider instance
- `registerProvider(type, factory)` - Registers a new provider type
- `getAvailableProviders()` - Lists registered providers

### 4. Base Provider Implementation

The `BaseLLMProvider` abstract class implements common functionality:

- Configuration validation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Error handling
- Common interface implementation

### 5. Configuration Management

Secure environment-based configuration:

- API keys are retrieved from environment variables
- Default models and settings can be configured
- Validation ensures required credentials are present
- Safe access patterns for both server and client-side code

### 6. Error Handling

Standardized error handling with:

- Typed error categories
- Retry recommendations
- Status codes
- Descriptive messages

### 7. Mock Provider

A fully functional mock provider for testing:

- Simulates network delay
- Provides deterministic responses
- Implements streaming capabilities
- Useful for development without API credentials

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables have been added:

```
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-pro
GEMINI_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
GEMINI_MAX_RETRIES=3
```

## Next Steps

- Implementation of the Gemini API provider in task 4.2
- Integration with the Vercel AI SDK in task 4.3
- Development of specialized fashion context in task 4.4

## Verification

To verify that the provider architecture is correctly implemented:

1. Check that all TypeScript types are properly defined and exported
2. Confirm that the factory pattern works by registering and creating providers
3. Verify that environment variables are correctly loaded and validated
4. Test the mock provider to ensure it fulfills the provider interface
5. Validate error handling with different error scenarios

The architecture is now ready for implementing specific providers like Gemini in the subsequent tasks.
