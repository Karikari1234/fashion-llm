# Task 1.1 Implementation Progress: Project Setup and Configuration

## Completed Tasks

### Directory Structure
- ✅ Created App Router architecture with appropriate directory structure:
  - `src/app/(auth)` - Routes for authentication
  - `src/app/(main)` - Protected main application routes
  - `src/app/api` - API route handlers
  - `src/components` - Reusable UI components
  - `src/lib` - Shared utilities and configurations
  - `src/models` - Database schemas and models
  - `src/types` - TypeScript type definitions

### Component Organization
- ✅ Set up UI components structure:
  - `components/ui` - Core UI elements like Button
  - `components/layout` - Layout components like Header

### Styling Configuration
- ✅ Configured Tailwind CSS with fashion-oriented color palette:
  - Added custom colors for fashion items (burgundy, navy, gold, etc.)
  - Created CSS variables for consistent theming
  - Set up utility classes for common UI patterns
  - Configured responsive design breakpoints

### Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created environment configuration files:
  - `.env.local` - Local environment variables
  - `.env.example` - Example file showing required environment variables

### Package Setup
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with required dependencies:
  - Added Gemini AI SDK (`@google/generative-ai`)
  - Added Vercel AI SDK (`ai`)
  - Added MongoDB for database functionality
  - Added Next-Auth for authentication
  - Added utility packages (clsx, tailwind-merge, zod)
  - Added developer tools (prettier, ESLint configs)

### Code Quality Tools
- ✅ Set up code quality and formatting tools:
  - Added Prettier configuration with consistent formatting rules (.prettierrc)
  - Enhanced ESLint configuration with recommended settings
  - Created npm scripts for linting and formatting

### Placeholder Files
- ✅ Created placeholder files to establish the project structure:
  - Created login page in the auth routes group
  - Created dashboard page in the main routes group
  - Added placeholder API route for authentication
  - Created UI component (Button) with proper TypeScript types
  - Added layout component (Header) for navigation
  - Created utility functions in the lib directory
  - Added TypeScript type definitions for core data models
  - Created placeholder model file for User data

### Documentation
- ✅ Updated project documentation:
  - Rewrote the README.md with project overview and setup instructions
  - Created this progress tracking document
  - Added comments to key files for better code understanding
  - Implemented a landing page with project description and features

## Next Steps

- Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn`
- Implement database connection with MongoDB (Task 1.2)
- Set up authentication system (Tasks 2.1, 2.2)
- Begin LLM integration with Gemini API (Task 4)

## Notes

- The project structure follows Next.js 14 best practices with App Router
- TypeScript is configured for type safety throughout the application
- Tailwind CSS is set up with custom theme extensions for fashion-specific styling
- Placeholder components and pages are prepared for feature implementation
- The landing page now reflects the FashionAIKit brand and features
